# So What is that?

This project is practice for fullstack app. You can register and login with the help of google. The credit required to send emails with the stripe payment system is received. has the right to send e-mails as much as the number of credits.
After the survey is created and the desired fields are filled, it is requested to be confirmed again, and then it is sent to the requested emails, so we reach our goal.
